Description

Credit Card Fraud Detection using an ANN with Python.

We pre-process the data using scaling and SMOTE.
We setup a neural network using Keras and Tensorflow.
We tune the hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Finally, we evaluate our model using the AUC score and PR curve,

Where we got our datasets from:
